- **Gradle 8.0+**: Build system (wrapper included)
- **GraalVM** (optional): For native image compilation

## Installation

### Using Gradle (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seerainer/ChessGame.git
   cd ChessGame
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

### Using Pre-built Distribution

1. **Build distribution**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew distTar  # Creates tar archive
   # OR
   ./gradlew distZip  # Creates zip archive
   ```

2. **Extract and run**:
   ```bash
   # Extract the archive from build/distributions/
   # Run the executable from bin/ChessGame (Unix) or bin/ChessGame.bat (Windows)
   ```

### Native Image Compilation

For faster startup times, compile to native image:

```bash
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

The native executable will be created in `build/native/nativeCompile/`.

## Usage

### Starting the Game

Launch the application and you'll see the chess board with an intuitive interface:

- **Drag and drop** pieces to make moves
- **Menu bar** for game options and settings

### Game Controls

- **New Game**: Start a fresh game
- **Game Mode**: Switch between Human vs Human, Human vs AI, AI vs AI

### AI Configuration

The AI can be configured with various parameters:
- **Search depth**: How many moves ahead to calculate
- **Time limits**: Maximum thinking time per move
- **Opening book**: Enable/disable opening book usage
- **Evaluation weights**: Fine-tune positional evaluation
